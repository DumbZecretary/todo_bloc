## Troubleshoot

This project using Hive. But Hive has a problem itself. Please check the link below:

https://github.com/hivedb/hive/issues/620

## TODO:

- Welcome Screen (User Domain)

- Save tasks by using another repository without Hive (maybe some SQL database)

- Complete the current tech specs

- Complete the current product specs

- Release to Store (optional)
